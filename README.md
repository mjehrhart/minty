Minty is an amazingly fast file deduplication app built in rust with a rust user interface. I say superb because it is rust on rust!.

Minty uses parrellism for a speedy and safe deduplication search. The app hashes the first (nth) bytes of each file to allow for direct comparisions, making for a truly reliable app.

The app searches and compares each individual file. Free up space by removing unwanted files.

You can view all duplicate files and batch delete them for each file collection. No more having to delete one file at time!
